# Two Patients, One Diagnosis

An interactive simulation that shows how **non-medical barriers** like insurance, transportation, paperwork, and work schedules can dramatically delay cancer treatment — even when patients receive the same diagnosis.

This project is designed to be **fast to understand, emotionally clear, and easy to demo**.

---

## What This Is

Two patients receive the **same cancer diagnosis**.

They go through the **same steps** toward treatment.

The only difference:
- One patient has access to support systems
- The other does not

With each step, delays stack up based on real-world barriers.  
The simulation makes one point clear:

> **Outcomes are shaped by access, not effort.**

---

## Why This Matters

Many delays in cancer care are **not medical**.
They come from:
- Insurance approvals
- Transportation issues
- Missed work
- Administrative backlog
- Clinic capacity limits

This project visualizes how those delays compound — and how support systems reduce them.

---

##  How It Works

- Click **Next Step** to advance both patients at the same time
- Each step may trigger a delay event
- Delays add days and stress
- Support tools reduce the impact of delays
- At the end, both patients reach treatment — but at very different times

There is **no waiting or countdown**. Everything resolves instantly to keep demos smooth.

##  Disclaimer

This is a **simulation**, not a medical model.

It is meant to:
- Illustrate systemic barriers
- Encourage discussion
- Highlight inequities in access to care

It does **not** predict individual outcomes.
